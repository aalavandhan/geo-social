      <h4>Motivation</h4>

      <p>Increasingly the past few years through GPS-enabled mobile devices, users publish their current geographical location to their friends, by “checking-in” at various places. Social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, have been augmented with check-in functionality. This trend in geosocial networking has created opportunities for novel location-based social interactions and advertising. Given such a geosocial dataset we wish to build a browser based application which provides a map based query interface wherein advertisers/super-users can design geospatial queries and visualize the returned results.</p>

      <h4><a href="#/gsr">Geo Social Ranking</a></h4>

      <p>Given a query location q and k, rank the users of a Geo-Social Network based on their distance to q, the number of their friends in the vicinity of q, and the connectivity of those friends and returns the top-k users. The focus is exploring the variations in ranking functions to achieve various results suited for particular applications.</p>

      <h4>Nearest Friend Group</h4>
      Given a query location point q and integers k,m, find the k nearest groups of m users to q, such that the users in every group are connected through a common friend (star).

      <blockquote>
        “the next group of five people who come to the restaurant will receive 20% discount”

      <h4>Geo-Social Keyword Search</h4>

      <p>Top-k Nearest, Popular and Relevant users query that, given a query location q and a set of terms Tq, outputs the top-k users based on their proximity to q, their social connectivity, and the similarity of their profiles to Tq. Top-k Nearest Socially and Textually Relevant POIs query , which, given a user v and a set of terms Tq, returns the top-k POIs based on their proximity to v, the number of check-ins by friends of v, and their similarity to Tq. Top-k Frequent Social Keywords in Range query that discovers the top-k keywords based on their frequency in pairs of friends located within a geographic area.</p>
      <p>Each query covers a wide range of real-world tasks, including advertising, context-based search, and market analysis. Some expected visualizations and output of the queries are highlighted below.</p>
